# Maze-Game
The 3 java files : LevelManager.java, Maze.java, and Player.java are the foundation of the game.
We need to implement Maze Generation Algorithms and Collision Detection
Other thing is the idea of Anuda to make the Maze level connect with each other
We also need a class for Mob (Monster) with mathematics questions as well
Lastly, add some graphics picture for mob, player, and maze
